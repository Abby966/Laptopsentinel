General Description of Laptop Sentinel 
The Laptop Sentinel system is designed to enhance campus security through a centralized 
platform for registering, tracking, and verifying laptops and in the future for other personal 
devices too. This systematic approach to device management provides several key 
functionalities: 
1. Device Registration 
The system registers essential student information, including name, ID, image, phone number, 
and PC serial number, creating a comprehensive database of authorized devices. This registration 
process ensures that only verified devices are permitted to leave campus premises. 
2. Verification Interface 
An intuitive interface allows security personnel to cross-check PC serial numbers against the 
database, facilitating efficient verification of students leaving the campus. This interface 
streamlines operations at security gates, reducing wait times and increasing overall efficiency. 
3. Theft Reporting 
Students can easily report stolen devices through the system, creating formal records for security 
personnel. This feature not only alerts guards to potential theft but also aids in the recovery 
process. 
4. Alert System for Security Personnel 
When a student reports a stolen PC, the system generates alerts for security guards, ensuring 
prompt action can be taken. This proactive approach enhances campus security and fosters a 
safer environment for students.
